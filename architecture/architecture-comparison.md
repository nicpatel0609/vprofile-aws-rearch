"""# Architecture Comparison: vProfile

This document outlines the key differences between the legacy VM-based architecture and the new AWS-based re-architected version of the `vProfile` application.

## üèõÔ∏è VM-Based Architecture (Before)

### Overview
- Manually provisioned VMs
- Static infrastructure
- Manual scaling and configuration

### Components
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX
- **App Server**: Apache Tomcat
- **Database**: MySQL on a single VM
- **Cache**: Memcached running on two separate VMs
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ
- **Storage**: NFS shared file system
- **Deployment**: SSH + WAR file manually deployed
- **Monitoring**: Local system logs

### Challenges
- No auto-scaling or fault tolerance
- Manual updates and configuration
- High operational overhead
- Difficult to secure and maintain
- Limited visibility (no centralized monitoring/logging)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Cloud Architecture (After)

### Overview
- Fully managed services
- Scalable, redundant, and fault-tolerant design
- Simplified maintenance and monitoring

### Components
- **DNS/CDN**: Route 53 + CloudFront
- **Compute**: Elastic Beanstalk + Auto Scaling Group (EC2)
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **App Server**: Apache Tomcat (Elastic Beanstalk environment)
- **Database**: Amazon RDS (MySQL, Multi-AZ)
- **Cache**: Memcached (Elasticache or manually on EC2)
- **Messaging**: Amazon MQ (managed ActiveMQ)
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 (for artifact storage)
- **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch
- **Deployment**: WAR file uploaded to S3 and auto-deployed via Elastic Beanstalk

### Improvements
- **Scalability**: Elastic Beanstalk handles scaling automatically
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ RDS + ALB + Auto Scaling
- **Security**: IAM roles, VPC subnetting, managed access controls
- **Observability**: CloudWatch for logs, alarms, and metrics
- **Reduced Ops**: No need to manually manage servers or databases

| Load Balancing     | NGINX                     | ALB (Elastic Load Balancing)           |
| App Deployment     | Manual (SSH & WAR)        | Elastic Beanstalk + S3                 |
| Database           | MySQL on VM               | RDS with Multi-AZ                      |
| Caching            | Memcached on VMs          | AWS Elasticache or EC2                |
| Messaging          | RabbitMQ                  | Amazon MQ (managed)                    |
| Monitoring         | Local logs                | Centralized with CloudWatch           |
| Artifact Storage   | NFS                       | Amazon S3                              |
| Availability       | Single point of failure   | High availability & fault tolerance    |
| Operations         | Manual, error-prone       | Automated, reliable                    |

## üëç Final Thoughts

The AWS-based redesign makes `vProfile` a production-ready application, aligning with cloud-native principles and DevOps best practices. It offers better performance, lower maintenance, and much higher reliability compared to the legacy VM-based model.
